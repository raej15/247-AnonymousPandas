What is an object?
An object is a data type that can take in collections of key-value pairs. A major difference between an object and other data types such as strings and numbers in JavaScript is that an objects can store different types of data as its values.
Example
You might use an object for a user. Each user could have a first name, last name, and weight. The first and last names would be a string. The weight would be a number. Ex: var user1 = {firstName:'Ann', lastName:'Smith', weight:'125'}
Objects and Arrays
Objects can be stored in an array. For example, to store users you could create user objects and add them to a users array.
