Scenario 1:

John Wisdom, a teacher logs into his account.
He previously created an awesome Python course.
View the different course module titles. There should be at least 10 different logical titles.
Pick the loops section, You should see course material describing the for loop.
Add a section to the loops module on the while loop. Make sure to give it a title, and a description describing how while loops work.
Go back to the module on loops, and look at the quiz, there should be 3 exiting questions on for loops.
Add a new question (with all details) about the while loop.

Scenario 2:
Scout Solace a student longs into her account.
She sees that she previously completed a JavaScript course.
She sees her grades on the different modules, and is proud of herself.
She prints out her JavaScript certificate.
She navigates back to her list of courses.
She sees that she is currently enrolled in a Python course.
She enters the Python course, and is directed to the module on loops, as she has previously completed the other modules.
She glances through the material on for loops and while loops.
Now she proceeds to take the quiz. She gets 2 / 4 questions correct.
She’s now in a bad mood! She is ready to make some damage. She views the comments for the loop module. There are 4 existing comments.
She sees a comment by Allie Anderson that says “These are throwing me for a loop… hehehe”
Scout leaves a reply to Allie’s comment and says. “Loops are for loop-sers.”
She decides she needs to better understand the material, so she prints out the material on loops. This does not include the quiz or the comments.
She then leaves the Python course.
Finally, she logs out of the system.
